# Dynamic-Job-Scheduler
It is an API based job scheduler(with cron-expressions) where we can create, update, delete, activate and deactivate jobs at anytime with REST calls.

* The jobs are persisted in the database MySQL when create and update request is made.
* The sheduler automatically picks the jobs and resumes them, after restarting when the application goes down.

# REST APIs:
* I have created a job called `APITriggerJob` for hitting an external REST API at regular intervals for demo purposes.
* The request body for below APIs is specific to `APITriggerJob` that I have created.
* You can customise and add new jobs as per your need in the `main/src/main/java/com/scheduling/app/job` folder.
```
// Create job end point = localhost:8080/api/scheduler/insert-job
// HTTP Method = POST
// JSON body =
{
    "jobName": "Github profile fetch job",
    "description": "This job fetches the Sanjay's Github profile details.",
    "cronExpression": "0/45 * * * * ?",
    "requestUrl": "https://github.com/sanjay235",
    "requestType": "GET",

}

// Get job details endpoint = localhost:8080/api/scheduler/get-job/235
// HTTP Method = GET

// Update Job endpoint = localhost:8080/api/scheduler/update-job/
